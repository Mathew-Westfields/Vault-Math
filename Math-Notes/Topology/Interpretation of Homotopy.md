[[Homotopy#Definition]]

# Homotopy as function into Pathspace
Since by [[Elementary Properties of C(X,Y)-Functors#C(X,Y) with Products and Sums| (semi)-canonical homeos using Hom-Functors]] and the [[Local Compactness#Strong Locally Compact|strong local compactness]] of $I$ it follows:
$$ C(X \times I, Y) \xra{\homeo} C(X,Y^I)$$
$$ H \lmt [x \mapsto H(x, \cdot)]$$
Geometrically this corresponds to telling each point $x \in X$ which path $\gamma_x:I \ra Y$ it traces out in $Y$.
Thus a homotopy is a map into the [[Pathspace|Pathspace]]

# Homotopy as Path in Functionspace
Let $X$ be [[Local Compactness#Strong Locally Compact|strong locally compact]] the it follows by [[Elementary Properties of C(X,Y)-Functors#C(X,Y) with Products and Sums| (semi)-canonical homeos using Hom-Functors]] that:
$$ C(X \times I, Y) \xra{\homeo} C(I,Y^X)$$
$$ H \lmt [t \mapsto H(\cdot,t)]$$
Geometrically this corresponds to a path $\gamma : I \lra C(X,Y)$
